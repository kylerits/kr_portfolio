        Art, aesthetics, and style will always be subjective. Good design continues to live within these camps, but will always strive for objectivity. A design is developed with a user in mind, therefore forcing the designer to think outside of himself. A website has to be accessible to everyone that has the ability to use a computer, today extending especially to tablet and smart phone users. This portfolio is meant to demonstrate my participation and growth within this industry of designers that is ever changing and improving.

        I really started delving into web design my sophomore year at Indiana University when I took an introductory course in the subject. I was more than familiar with HTML and CSS, and up until this point I felt myself pulled between my original passion of video production and a the much more practical study of informatics. Web design became a way for me to utilize the skills that I was developing while learning programming and data systems, and turning that into something visual.

        Web design and development is an industry growing at an incredible pace with new technologies being introduced every day. Learning is something that I have to do if I want to continue. You show me someone that calls themselves a master at web design, and in two month's time I can show you someone out of date. I work very much through trial and error and I always try to learn from my mistakes. I will always strive for my next project to be better than this one, and I hope for web design and front-end development to be something that I am sort of good at.
