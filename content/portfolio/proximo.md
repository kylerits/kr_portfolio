## The Scope

Proximo is beautifully designed by my colleagues at Big, matching the tone of the restaurant itself wonderfully. My role as the developer was the match the quality of the design with quality code.

## The Technology

Built on top of Craft CMS, the site leverages the browser's lifecycle in order to produce more dynamic movement between pages. There is subtle movement throughout the site with images and menus. The idea was to keep everything in a flow.
