## The Scope
Big was looking to "practice what they preach" in approach to this project. Through extensive research by the strategy team, the site was designed to most optimally communicate Big's brand. My approach as the developer was to match the level of detail everyone put into this project with the development of the site itself. It had to be fast and dynamic, both in movement and its ability to scale.

## The Technology
This website was a really fun build. It was developed with Nuxt, a Vue framework that specializes in scalability. Nuxt allows Big to function with Headless CMS compiling content for the blog and other dynamic fields. Because the site was built using Vue, subtle animations were simple to implement.
